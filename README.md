## Hi there 👋

💬 About

I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong background in finance and business management. After over a decade in auditing and entrepreneurship, I transitioned into tech to build products that merge data, automation, and design into meaningful user experiences.

Recently graduated from Le Wagon’s AI Software Development Bootcamp, where I built AI-powered web apps using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, and OpenAI APIs. This hands-on program strengthened my technical foundation and passion for turning complex ideas into clean, functional products.

As Director of Digital Grafic Ibiza, S.L., I oversee the production and island-wide distribution of three magazines and the real-estate platform IBICASA.com, leading its transition from print to digital media. Managing operations, clients, and technology taught me to bridge creativity with business strategy and deliver results across diverse teams.

🧠 Key strengths

- Full-Stack Development (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

- AI Integration (OpenAI APIs, LLMs, Automation)

- Data-driven problem solving & analytical thinking

- Financial management and strategic planning

- Leadership & digital transformation

I’m passionate about building useful, human-centered technology and connecting business insight with technical execution.

Currently developing independent AI projects and open to remote opportunities with teams focused on innovation and real-world impact.
